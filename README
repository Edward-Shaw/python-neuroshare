Python Bindings for Neuroshare
==============================

The Neuroshare API is an standardize API for accessing
neurophysiology data stored in vendor-specific binary formats
in a vendor-neutral way. See
     		    http://neuroshare.org
for more information.

The aim of this library is to provide a high level interface
to the Neuroshare API, i.e. it focuses on API usability more
then being a mere python version of the C API. Thus none of
the original Neuroshare API calls are directly exposed but the
interface is through python objections that resemble (more or
less) the Neuroshare Entities.


Installation
------------

The requirements to install the python-neuroshare are the
'setuptools' and the python development files and a working
C compiler (clang, gcc). For Debian based distributions,
e.g. Ubuntu, this can easily be done with:

	$ sudo apt-get install clang python-setuptools python-dev

After that, python-neuroshare is installed with the following
command:

	$ sudo python setup.py install


Usage
-----

   Opening a file:

	>> import neuroshare as ns
	>> fd = ns.File ("NeuroshareExample.mcd")

   Iterate over the entities in the file:

   	>> for entity in fd.list_entities():
        >>    print entity.label, entity.entity_type
	>>    ... do something else with entity ...
