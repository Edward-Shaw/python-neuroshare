Python Bindings for Neuroshare
==============================

The Neuroshare API is an standardize API for accessing
neurophysiology data stored in vendor-specific binary formats
in a vendor-neutral way. See
     		    http://neuroshare.org
for more information.

The aim of this library is to provide a high level interface
to the Neuroshare API, i.e. it focuses on API usability more
then being a mere python version of the C API. Thus none of
the original Neuroshare API calls are directly exposed but the
interface is through python objections that resemble (more or
less) the Neuroshare Entities.
